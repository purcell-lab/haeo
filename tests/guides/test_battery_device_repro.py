"""Live reproduction for the missing battery device/entities bug.

Drives the real Home Assistant UI config flow (via Playwright against a live
in-process instance) to create an inverter, a grid, and a battery, then
inspects the backend device and entity registries to confirm that a device
and entities are created for the battery as they are for the grid.

The battery is added last on purpose: it is the only element whose flow writes
surfaced policy rules to the policy subentry before creating its own subentry,
and that policy write triggers an eager reload that tears the entry down before
the battery subentry commits. If another element were created afterwards, its
reload would rebuild the entry and mask the bug, so the battery must be the
final commit for the reproduction to be deterministic.

Run with:
    uv run pytest tests/guides/test_battery_device_repro.py -m guide -v
