# Battery Modeling

The Battery device composes a single [Battery model](../model-layer/elements/battery.md) element and a single [Connection](../model-layer/connections/connection.md).
SOC preferences are encoded directly in the connection via the SOC pricing segment.

## Model Elements Created

    subgraph deviceBattery["Device:battery_main"]

        Conn["Connection battery_main:connection"]
    end
    Target[ConnectionTarget]
    Battery --> Conn
    Conn --> Target
```

The adapter creates two model elements:

| Model Element                                          | Name               | Parameters From Configuration                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| [Battery](../model-layer/elements/battery.md)          | `{name}`           | Capacity range, initial charge, salvage value    |
| [Connection](../model-layer/connections/connection.md) | `{name}:discharge` | Efficiency, power limits, SOC pricing (optional) |
| [Connection](../model-layer/connections/connection.md) | `{name}:charge`    | Efficiency, power limits                         |

## Architecture Details

### Capacity range and offsets

The battery model tracks stored energy within a bounded range:

- **Lower bound**: undercharge percentage when configured, otherwise `min_charge_percentage`
- **Upper bound**: overcharge percentage when configured, otherwise `max_charge_percentage`

The model capacity is:

$$
C_{\text{model}}(t) = (\text{upper\%}(t) - \text{lower\%}(t)) \cdot C(t)
$$

Stored energy is measured relative to the lower bound.
User-facing energy and SOC add the lower bound offset back to the model values.

### SOC pricing segment

When undercharge or overcharge costs are configured, the connection includes the SOC pricing segment:

- **Undercharge penalty** applies when SOC falls below `min_charge_percentage`
- **Overcharge penalty** applies when SOC rises above `max_charge_percentage`

These are soft constraints driven by cost.
The battery can operate outside the preferred range when prices justify it, but it will never exceed the configured lower/upper bounds.

### Salvage value

The battery element can include a terminal salvage value.
This assigns a per-kWh value to the final stored energy at the horizon end.
It discourages draining the battery to zero when energy is still valuable beyond the forecast window.

## Devices Created

Battery creates a single Home Assistant device:

| Device  | Name     | Created When | Purpose                           |
| ------- | -------- | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Battery | `{name}` | Always       | Power, energy, SOC, shadow prices |
