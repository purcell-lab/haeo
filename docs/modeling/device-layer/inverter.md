# Inverter Modeling

The Inverter device composes a [Node](../model-layer/elements/node.md) (as a DC bus junction) with an implicit [Connection](../model-layer/connections/connection.md) to model bidirectional DC/AC power conversion with separate efficiency and power limits per direction.

## Configuration Examples

### Basic Hybrid Inverter

| Field                   | Value         |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |
| **Name**                | Main Inverter |
| **AC Connection**       | Home Bus      |
| **DC to AC Efficiency** | 97.0          |
| **AC to DC Efficiency** | 97.0          |

### With Power Limits

| Field                   | Value           |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| **Name**                | Hybrid Inverter |
| **AC Connection**       | Home Bus        |
| **DC to AC Efficiency** | 96.0            |
| **AC to DC Efficiency** | 95.0            |
| **Max DC to AC Power**  | 5.0             |
| **Max AC to DC Power**  | 5.0             |

## Typical Use Cases

**Hybrid Inverter Systems**:
Connect batteries and solar panels to the inverter's DC bus, with the AC side connecting to the home bus where loads and grid are attached.

**DC-Coupled Solar + Battery**:
When solar and battery share a DC bus, the inverter handles all DC/AC conversion.
This models systems where solar feeds the battery directly on the DC side.

**Asymmetric Power Ratings**:
Some inverters have different power ratings for inverting vs. rectifying.
Configure separate `max_power_source_target` and `max_power_target_source` to model this.

## Physical Interpretation

The Inverter represents a power electronics device that converts between DC and AC power.
The DC bus acts as a junction point where DC devices (batteries, solar panels with DC output) connect,
while the AC side connects to your home's AC network.

### Configuration Guidelines

- **Efficiency Values**: Typical modern inverters achieve 95-98% efficiency.
    Set slightly lower values to account for real-world losses.
- **Separate Efficiencies**: Rectifying (AC to DC) efficiency may differ from inverting (DC to AC).
    Measure or consult specifications for accurate values.
- **Power Limits**: Configure limits matching your inverter's continuous power rating.
    Peak/surge ratings should not be used as they are not sustainable.
- **DC Bus Connections**: Other elements (batteries, PV) should connect to the inverter's DC bus by specifying the inverter name as their connection target.
