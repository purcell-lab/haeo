# Battery Section Modeling

The Battery Section device provides direct access to the model layer [Battery](../model-layer/elements/battery.md) element.
Unlike the standard Battery element which composes multiple sections with connections and nodes,
this element creates a single battery section that must be connected manually via Connection elements.

## Model Elements Created

    subgraph "Device"
        Battery["Battery<br/>{name}"]
    end
```

| Model Element                                 | Name     | Parameters From Configuration  |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| [Battery](../model-layer/elements/battery.md) | `{name}` | All parameters mapped directly |

## Devices Created

Battery Section creates 1 device in Home Assistant:

| Device  | Name     | Created When | Purpose                              |
| ------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Primary | `{name}` | Always       | Direct access to model layer Battery |

## Parameter Mapping

The adapter passes user configuration directly to the Battery model element:

| User Configuration | Model Element | Model Parameter  | Notes                       |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| `name`             | Battery       | `name`           | Element name                |
| `capacity`         | Battery       | `capacity`       | Battery capacity (kWh)      |
| `initial_charge`   | Battery       | `initial_charge` | Initial stored energy (kWh) |

## Configuration Example

### Basic Configuration

| Field              | Value                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| **Name**           | Battery Section 1       |
| **Capacity**       | sensor.battery_capacity |
| **Initial Charge** | sensor.battery_energy   |

## Typical Use Cases

**Direct Model Access**:
Use Battery Section when you need direct control over battery modeling without the multi-section composition provided by the standard Battery element.

**Custom Battery Topologies**:
Create custom battery configurations by manually connecting multiple Battery Section elements with Connection elements and nodes.

**Advanced Modeling**:
Access raw model layer Battery behavior for research, testing, or advanced optimization scenarios.

## Physical Interpretation

Battery Section represents a single-section energy storage device with no implicit connections or internal routing.
All power flow must be explicitly configured via Connection elements.

### Configuration Guidelines

- **Manual Connections Required**: Unlike the standard Battery element, Battery Section does not create implicit connections.
    You must create Connection elements to connect it to nodes or other elements.
- **Single Section Only**: Battery Section creates a single battery section without SOC region modeling.
    For multi-section behavior, use the standard Battery element or compose multiple Battery Section elements manually.
- **Direct Model Mapping**: All configuration parameters map directly to the model layer Battery element with no transformation.
