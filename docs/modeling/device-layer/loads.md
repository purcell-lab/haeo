# Load modeling

The Load device composes a [Node](../model-layer/elements/node.md) (power sink only) with an implicit [Connection](../model-layer/connections/connection.md) to model power consumption based on forecast data.
The connection includes a power limit segment.

## Configuration Examples

### Variable Load (Forecast)

| Field          | Value                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Name**       | House Load                 |
| **Forecast**   | sensor.home_power_forecast |
| **Connection** | Home Bus                   |

### Constant Load

| Field          | Value     |
| -------------- | --------- |
| **Name**       | Base Load |
| **Forecast**   | 2.5       |
| **Connection** | Home Bus  |

## Typical Use Cases

**Whole-House Consumption**:
Use historical data or forecasting services to predict total home power consumption.
Enables optimizer to time battery discharge and grid import optimally.

**Constant Base Load**:
Model always-on consumption (refrigerator, networking equipment) with a fixed power value.

**Scheduled Loads**:
Model predictable loads like pool pumps, HVAC, or EV charging with time-varying forecasts.

## Physical Interpretation

Load represents power consumption that the system can choose to satisfy up to a forecast limit.
When curtailment (shedding) is disabled, the forecast is enforced exactly.
When enabled, the optimizer may shed the load if that reduces total system cost.

The model represents average power within each optimization period.
This means reduced power can be interpreted as partial operation in whatever way fits the physical device (duty cycle, throttling, staging, etc.).

### Threshold price

A sheddable load can also expose a **threshold price** (\$/kWh): the maximum amount the user is willing to pay to serve this load.
The optimizer dispatches the load only while the marginal value of energy at its connection node is at or below the threshold; above that, the load sheds.
The default threshold of \$0 leaves the LP unchanged from the original behaviour.

The comparison is against the **shadow price (LP dual) of the node selected in the load's *Connection* field** — not the raw grid import tariff.
When a battery or solar can supply that node more cheaply than the grid in a given interval, the dual tracks the cheaper source and the load can keep running even while the grid tariff is above the threshold.
If you want the threshold to act directly on the grid tariff, connect the load to the grid element instead of to an intermediate switchboard.
See [Load shedding via threshold price](../shedding.md) for the full derivation, plus the matching shadow-price sensor on each node device (e.g. `sensor.switchboard_node_power_balance_energy_price`).

For example, a load with `forecast = 5 kW` and `threshold_price = $0.30/kWh` connected to a switchboard whose marginal energy price varies will be served while local energy is cheaper than \$0.30/kWh and will shed when it is more expensive.

This is implemented as a `PricingSegment` on the load's connection with `price = -threshold_price`, so the LP minimisation gains a benefit equal to `threshold_price × p_load × Δt` for every period the load is served.
The threshold-price field is ignored when curtailment is disabled (fixed loads cannot shed).

### Configuration Guidelines

- **Forecast Accuracy**:
    Critical for optimization quality.
    Underestimating causes real system to import more than planned.
    Overestimating may cause infeasibility.
    See [Forecasts and Sensors](../../user-guide/forecasts-and-sensors.md).
- **Constant vs Variable**:
    Use constant values for stable always-on loads.
    Use forecast sensors for time-varying consumption patterns.
- **Multiple Loads**:
    Create separate Load elements for different consumption categories (base load, HVAC, EV charging) to track them independently.
- **Fixed Power**:
    When curtailment is disabled, consumption equals the forecast exactly.
    When enabled, consumption may be reduced below the forecast based on economics and constraints.
