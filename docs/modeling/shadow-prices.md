# Shadow Prices

Shadow prices are dual values from the linear programming optimization.
They quantify how much the total objective would improve if a constraint were relaxed by one unit.
In HAEO, shadow prices help explain why the optimizer makes certain decisions and highlight where additional flexibility creates the most value.

## What shadow prices tell you

Every constraint in the optimization problem has an associated shadow price.
This value represents the marginal benefit of loosening that constraint—essentially answering the question: "How much would I save if I could push this limit by one more unit?"

A key distinction: shadow prices show what you would pay for *additional* capacity, not what you are paying for resources already allocated.
When a constraint is not limiting the solution (slack), its shadow price is zero.
When a constraint is actively restricting the optimizer (binding), the shadow price becomes non-zero.

## Example: Marginal cost of power

The node balance constraint ensures that power flowing into a node equals power flowing out.
Its shadow price represents the marginal cost of power at that location and time.

This is not the price you pay for power currently consumed.
It is the price you would pay to increase (or save by decreasing) consumption by one kilowatt at that node in that time step.

When grid prices are high, the node balance shadow price rises because additional consumption would require expensive imports.
When local generation exceeds demand, the shadow price may drop to zero or become negative, indicating that additional consumption would actually help by absorbing surplus.

## Example: Solar forecast limit

The solar forecast limit constrains solar output to the predicted generation.
Its shadow price reveals when this physical limit is restricting the optimizer.

During midday when prices are negative, curtailment may already be occurring.
The optimizer cannot use all available solar, so more generation would not help.
The shadow price is zero because the constraint is slack—the limit is not what's holding the system back.

At night, the situation reverses.
The forecast limit binds at zero (no sun), but the optimizer would clearly benefit from more solar output to avoid expensive imports or to charge the battery.
The shadow price rises, signaling: "More solar power here would reduce total cost."
This is physically impossible, of course, but the shadow price makes the optimizer's preference visible.

This pattern—zero when slack, non-zero when binding—applies to all shadow prices and makes them useful for identifying system bottlenecks.

## Categories of shadow prices

All HAEO shadow-price sensors are emitted in **\$/kWh** so they sit on the same axis as tariffs and other energy-priced quantities.
Internally the LP layer computes the raw duals in their native units (\$/kW for power-limit constraints, \$/kWh for energy-coupled constraints); the adapter publication layer converts \$/kW duals to \$/kWh by dividing by the period length before exposing them to Home Assistant.
Individual elements document their specific shadow prices, but the interpretation is uniform: the value shows the marginal benefit of relaxing that constraint, per kWh of slack.

## How \$/kW duals are converted

Shadow prices on instantaneous power constraints come from a dual variable that is dimensionally \$/kW.
That value answers "how much would the objective improve if I could exceed the power limit by 1 kW for the duration of this period?"
For comparison with tariffs, which are normally quoted in \$/kWh, the dual is re-expressed in energy units by dividing by the period length:

\$/kWh = (\$/kW) / Δt[hours]

Because HAEO supports variable-width intervals, Δt is taken from `Element.periods` for that period.
The user only sees the \$/kWh form; the conversion is performed once per period in the adapter layer.

All published sensors use the suffix `_shadow_energy_price` and emit \$/kWh.

### Worked example

For a 5-minute period (Δt = 1/12 h), a raw \$/kW dual of `0.10` becomes a `$/kWh` published value of `0.10 / (1/12) = 1.20`.

## Diagnostic visibility

Shadow-price sensors are tagged as `EntityCategory.DIAGNOSTIC`.
They are diagnostic indicators of solver behaviour, not setpoints to act on directly, so they are hidden by default in the Home Assistant UI.
Templates and dashboards that reference them by entity ID continue to work; users who want them on a default dashboard can unhide them per entity.

## Practical interpretation

**Sign convention**: Positive shadow prices indicate that loosening the constraint would reduce total cost.
Negative values suggest that tightening the constraint would help (less common in practice).

**Zero values**: A shadow price of zero means the constraint is not currently limiting the solution.
The optimizer has headroom, so relaxing the limit would not change its decisions.

**Non-zero values**: When a shadow price is non-zero, the constraint is binding.
The magnitude indicates how valuable additional capacity would be at that point.
