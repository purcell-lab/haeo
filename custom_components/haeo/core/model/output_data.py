    """Specification for an output exposed by a model element.

    Attributes:
        type: The output type (power, energy, SOC, etc.).
        unit: The unit of measurement for the output values (e.g., "W", "Wh", "%").
        values: The sequence of output values.
        direction: Power flow direction from the energy system's perspective.
            "+" = production: power added to the system (solar generation, battery discharge, grid import).
            "-" = consumption: power removed from the system (load demand, battery charge, grid export).
            None = non-directional output (SOC, prices, energy, shadow prices).
        advanced: Whether the output is intended for advanced diagnostics only.
        state_last: If True, the sensor state uses the last value instead of the first.
            Use for cumulative values where the total is the meaningful current state.
        state_source: Optional free-form label describing how ``state`` is derived,
            emitted verbatim as the ``state_source`` sensor attribute. When None,
            the coordinator publishes a default label inferred from ``state_last``
            (``"horizon_first"`` or ``"horizon_last"``). Adapters may set this
            explicitly to advertise other derivations (e.g. ``"measured"`` when an
            output mirrors a measured input rather than a horizon value).
        is_forecast: If True, the sensor state is a planned (forecast) value from the
            optimizer rather than a measurement. State value is unchanged for back-compat,
            but two extra-state attributes are emitted so downstream automations can
            distinguish planned values from measurements:
              - ``is_forecast: true``
              - ``next_planned: <values[0]>``
            Mitigates hass-energy/haeo#477 (transient grid disturbances when horizon[0]
            swings are interpreted as measured setpoints).
        priority: Connection time-preference priority. Lower values are preferred
            earlier by the secondary objective. None for non-connection outputs.
        fixed: Whether the output is constrained to equal its forecast (no curtailment).
