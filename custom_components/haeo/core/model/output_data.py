    """Specification for an output exposed by a model element.

    Attributes:
        type: The output type (power, energy, SOC, etc.).
        unit: The unit of measurement for the output values (e.g., "W", "Wh", "%").
        values: The sequence of output values.
        direction: Power flow direction from the energy system's perspective.
            "+" = production: power added to the system (solar generation, battery discharge, grid import).
            "-" = consumption: power removed from the system (load demand, battery charge, grid export).
            None = non-directional output (SOC, prices, energy, shadow prices).
        advanced: Whether the output is intended for advanced diagnostics only.
        state_last: If True, the sensor state uses the last value instead of the first.
            Use for cumulative values where the total is the meaningful current state.
        state: Optional scalar that overrides the sensor state (taking precedence over
            ``state_last`` / ``values[0]``). Use when the per-interval ``values``
            sequence should drive the forecast attribute but a separately computed
            scalar (e.g. a clipped 24h total or a running total) is the meaningful
            state.
        priority: Connection time-preference priority. Lower values are preferred
            earlier by the secondary objective. None for non-connection outputs.
        fixed: Whether the output is constrained to equal its forecast (no curtailment).
        display_precision: Suggested number of decimal places to display in the UI.
            Surfaces as Home Assistant's ``suggested_display_precision`` on the
            sensor entity. Use to override HAEO's smart-rounding default when a
            sensor has a natural display scale (e.g. dollars to 2 dp). None
            preserves the existing smart-rounding behaviour.
